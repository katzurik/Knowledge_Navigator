Knowledge Navigator is a system for exploring scientific literature by organizing search results from broad queries into a structured hierarchy of topics and subtopics. This structure helps users navigate research themes, refine their focus, and discover more relevant documents. By combining LLMs with cluster-based methods, we enable an innovative browsing experience. We evaluate the system on the CLUSTREC-COVID and SCITOC benchmarks, and provide the code, prompts, and benchmarks publicly.
## System Overview

</p>
Knowledge Navigator system takes a corpus of retrieved scientific documents for a given query and outputs an organized two-level thematic structure of subtopics spanning that topical query. The system's functionality is supported by the following conceptual steps: corpus construction, embedding and clustering of documents, describing and naming clusters, filtering irrelevant clusters, grouping the clusters into a thematic hierarchy, and subtopic query generation. This is implemented in a five-component architecture that largely follows the conceptual steps. This architecture enables LLMs to generate grounded outputs based on a large number of source documents, a crucial requirement for organizing and structuring large corpora.
